1. man -k
In my case, I used man man command to find out
 the option of man -k, 
which allows me to find 
all the man pages that contain a 
specific word in either their name or their description.

2. /usr/bin/cp and /usr/bin/wc
I used the comman which cp and which wc to find out

3. find /usr/bin -name "?" -executable
 There are 3 of them:
/usr/bin/[
This is part of the shell builtin test.
/usr/bin/X
This is Xorg,
 which is a full featured X server created for Unix like operating systems.
/usr/bin/w
This can display the users who is logging on and what they are doing.

4. /etc/alternatives/emacs
readlink command can print value of a symbolic link. 
I used readlink /usr/bin/emacs to find out.

5. o-x means removes the permission of execute for owner. g-s means
 that it sets the permission for group users on execution, i.e. 
it will allow the group user execute with permissions from the owner.

6. find -mtime 21
Using man find command, I found the option of
 -mtime n which allows you to find the files that were modified n*24 hours ago.

7. I did not find any

8. 16
I first navigate to the directory /bin and then run the command find . -type l 
-ls

9. libpopt.so.0.0.0
I fist navigate to the corresponding directory and then use ls -lrt to find out
 the oldest file.

10. /usr/bin
By running the command readlink -f locale, I got the answer.

11. M-x sort-lines, sort-paragraphs, sort-pages, sort-fields, sort-columns, sor
t-numeric-fields. I learned these from reading through the emacs reference.

12. C-M-a: going to the beginning of defun
C-M-b: moving backforward
C-M-c: existing current recursive edit
C-M-d:
C-M-e: going to the end of defun
C-M-f: moving forwards
C-M-g: rehighlighting a range of line 
C-M-h: Put region around the defun

13. abort partially typed or executing command or current research

14. Yank function pastes the last stretch of killed text.

15. emacs dired can list some subdirectories. 
And the coloring of different files are different.
