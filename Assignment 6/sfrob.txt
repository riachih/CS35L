I used the following three commands to compare:
time ./sfrobu < output2.txt > result1.txt
time ./sfrob < output2.txt > result2.txt
time ./sfrobs < output2.txt > result3.txt

Here is the result I got from the above commands:
Comparisons: 4999999
real    0m6.343s
user    0m0.275s
sys 0m5.847s

real    0m4.746s
user    0m0.253s
sys 0m4.425s

real	0m0.026s
user	0m0.009s
sys	0m0.007s

I used the same file I uscreated earlier, which is 
of the size of 5MB. Here, we can see that the shell
script performs the best, following by the buffered
version then unbuffered version. This makes sense
since the unbuffered version needs to keep asking
for permission for system call.
